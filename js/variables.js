// A container for storing data 
/* A variable behaves as if it was the value that it contains */
// Can store any value in a variable 
// BE SURE TO USE CamelCase when naming variables
// Example: firstName , lastName, birthDate, etc.

// Scope 
/* Variables within the scope means you can only use the variable that lies within the bracket */

// Global scope 
/* Variables that are outside of the scope and can be use from anywhere */

// Two steps: 
// 1. Declaration ( var, let, const) (var is outdated) 
// 2. Assignment ( = assignment operator) 

// let variable allows value to be change later 
let firstName = "Thinh"; // string 
let age = "26"; // string 
let age2 = 26; // number 
let student = true; // boolean 

// const is a variable that the value cannot be change
// const is more prefer
const birthDate = "November 30, 1996";
